            The teaching of Engineering in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka started in October 1961 by a team of workers form the Netherlands University Foundation. The first group of teaching staff in the Department of Electrical Engineering were recruited in the 1962/1963 academic year and comprised three Lecturers namely: Dr. C. Onianwu, Dr. M. A. Nwachukwu and Mr. Vander Knaap (a Dutch). In the 1965/1966 academic year, the Electrical Engineering Department, under the Faculty of Engineering, graduated its first students who were three in number namely Iwuagwu, Ekpo and Orjiugo.


            At the end of the civil war, which disrupted academic activities in the University of Nigeria from July 1967 to January 1970, the University came fully back to life in the 1970/1971 academic year. In the 1975/1976 academic year the Department was renamed the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering in recognition of the increasing growth of the Electronics discipline. In 1981, Electrical Engineering and Electronic Engineering became separate Departments, with Electrical Engineering concentrating in the areas of Electromagnetic Field Theory, Electrical Machines, Power Systems, Power Electronics and Automatic Control while Computer Organization, Instrumentation, Communications and Electronic Circuits remained essential supplementary courses. In the 1983/1985 academic year, the Department introduced the postgraduate programme in the four specialist areas of Electrical Machines, Power Systems, Power Electronics and Automatic Control. Improvement in the quality and number of both students and staff has been growing from year to year resulting in steady improvement of the quality of teaching and research in the Department.

        <p class="M1">
            Mechanical Engineering includes the science and art of formulation, design, development, manufacturing and control of systems and components for the conversion of Energy and materials into useful mechanical work. These may include both power-generating machines and machines that transform and consume this power, such as nuclear and fossil power plants, propulsion devices, engines, turbines, motors, control mechanisms, transportation systems (automobiles, trains, space vehicles, marine vehicles, etc.), refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, cryogenic systems, manufacturing machines and systems, materials handling and earth-moving devices. The field requires a basic knowledge of mechanics of solids, fluids, and machines, materials, machine design, heat power, thermodynamics, heat transfer, manufacturing processes, industrial engineering, management science, optimization, and systems analysis.

            In line with modern trends in curriculum development in Mechanical Engineering the world over, the programme includes basic subjects common to all engineering fields, fundamental subjects important to all mechanical engineers, and specialization in one or more areas of mechanical engineering. Apart from common courses of 12 credits options offered in the final year, final year students embrace 4 courses each of 4 credits, with a maximum of 16 credits per option. These include Heat/Thermal Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, Design and Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Management Science, Applied Mechanics and Biomechanics, and Aeronautical Engineering. For students wishing to major in Chemical Engineering, Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, options are available from third year of study.

            The Department started in 1961/62 with the undergraduate programme; while the post-graduate programme was added in 1980/81. Over these years, the pursuit of excellence in both the undergraduate and postgraduate programmes remains the main thrust and emphases of the Department. From inception up to 1979/80, the Department offered four- and five- year programmes leading to the bachelorâ€™s degree B.Sc in Civil Engineering. By the decision of the Faculty Board of Engineering and with the popular support of the students the Bachelor of Science degree was changed to the Bachelor of Engineering B.Eng degree in 1979/80 with the approval of the University Senate .


            Over the years, necessary changes were made in the academic curriculum in order to make the programme more relevant to the needs of the society. Significant among such changes are the introduction of General Studies Courses; Computer Programming; Student Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES); Entrepreneurship; Water Resources and Environmental Engineering etc. With the advent of the National Universities Commission (NUC) benchmarks for minimum credit load and course content for Nigerian Universities, the Department complied as required in the curriculum. The current programme lays more emphasis on civil engineering courses from the 300-Level. The department is working towards updating the academic programme to meet the ever changing need of the society. Our new programme is currently with the curriculum approval committee of the University senate.
